This model of Pyhton uses the libraries uses OpenCv and simple facerec
We fed some pictures of celebs and some pictures of our own peers to predict the accuracy of the model and believe me, it was not so bad!!

Built using <a href = "http://dlib.net/" >dlib's</a> state of the art face recognition built using deep learning. <br>
This also model has an accuracy of <b>99.38%</b> on the <a href = "https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/">Labelled faces in the wild </a> dataset<br>
